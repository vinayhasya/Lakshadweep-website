<h2>Geography of Lakshadweep </h2>
</center>
<p>Lakshadweep (Malayalam: [lɐkʂɐd̪βʷiːbɨ̆]) is a union territory of India. It is an archipelago of 36 islands serving as the maritime boundary between the Arabian Sea to the west and the Laccadive Sea to the east. It is located 200 to 440 km (120 to 270 mi) off the Malabar Coast of India.</p>
<p>The name Lakshadweep means "one lakh islands" in Malayalam and Sanskrit, though the Lakshadweep islands are just one part of the archipelago of no more than a hundred islands. Jeseri is the primary as well as the widely spoken native language in the territory.The islands form the smallest union territory of India and their total surface area is approximately 32 km2 (12 sq mi). The lagoon area covers about 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), the territorial waters area 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and the exclusive economic zone area 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The region forms a single Indian district with 10 subdivisions. Kavaratti serves as the capital of the Union Territory and the region comes under the jurisdiction of Kerala High Court. The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep–Maldives–Chagos group of islands, which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range, the Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge.The Lakshadweep originally consisted of 36 islands; however, due to the Parali 1 island being submerged in water due to sea erosion, 35 islands remain.</p>

<h2>History of Lakshadweeep</h2>
</center>
<p>As the islands have no aboriginal inhabitants, scholars have suggested different histories for the settlement of these islands. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of human settlement in the region around 1500 BCE, and Jataka stories of Buddhism mentioned these islands, which documented the spread of Buddhism to the islands during 6th century BCE. Buddhist era archaeological finds are also notable, during Buddhist era monk Sanghamitra is believed to have visited the island. The islands have long been known to sailors, as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century CE to the region in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. There are references to the control of the islands by the Cheras in the Sangam Patiṟṟuppattu. Local traditions and legends attribute the first settlement on these islands to the period of Cheraman Perumal, the last Chera king of Kerala. The oldest inhabited islands in the group are Amini, Kalpeni, Andrott, Kavaratti, and Agatti.
According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is located on the island of Andrott.
During the 11th century, the islands came under the rule of the Late Cholas when the Cholas conquered parts of Kerala and subsequently the islands came under the Kingdom of Kannur. The islands had an important role in the Indian Ocean trade during the medieval period as they were located in the principal trade route which connected the Middle East with Malabar Coast, Ceylon, and Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Malaysia).
In the 16th century, the Portuguese ruled the seas between Ormus and the Malabar Coast and south to Ceylon. As early as 1498 when the Vasco da Gama arrived at Kozhikode during the Age of Discovery, they took control of the archipelago (called Laquedivas by them), later on to exploit coir production, until the islanders expelled them in 1545. In the mid 16th century all the inhabited islands of the Lakshadweep were conferred as jagir on the ruling family of the Cannanore Kingdom (Arakkal Kingdom) by the Chirakkal or Kolattiri Raja in order to grant protection from the Portuguese. The Arakkal kingdom had jurisdiction over Laccadive and Amindivi groups of islands, in addition to the city of Kannur. The islands are also mentioned in great detail in the stories of the Arab traveller Ibn Batuta.
The Aminidivi group of islands (Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlath, and Bitra) came under the rule of Tipu Sultan in 1787. They were passed to British control after the Third Anglo-Mysore War and were attached to Kasaragod Taluk of South Canara. The rest of the islands (Agatti, Andrott, Minicoy, Kavaratti, Kalpeni, and Bangaram) remained under the suzerainty of the Arakkal family of Kannur in return for a payment of annual tribute. The British took over the administration of those islands for nonpayment of arrears. These islands were attached to the Malabar district of the Madras Presidency during the British Raj. Later it was placed under Kozhikode Taluk.
On 1 November 1956, during the reorganization of Indian states, the Lakshadweep islands were separated from Malabar District and organised into a separate union territory for administrative purposes. The new territory was called Laccadive, Minicoy, and Amindivi Islands before adopting the Lakshadweep name on 1 November 1973. The headquarters of the new union territory remained at Kozhikode for nearly a decade until 1964. In 1964, the seat of administrator of the islands was shifted to Kavaratti.
To safeguard India's vital shipping lanes to the Middle East, and the growing relevance of the islands in security considerations, an Indian Navy base, INS Dweeprakshak, was commissioned on Kavaratti island.</p>

<h3>Kolkali dance</h3>
<p>The Kolkali dance literally translates as stick dance.

The dance begins with a slow pace but slowly as the time passes the rhythm becomes fast and ultimately reaches to the height of frenzy. With the accompanied folk songs the dancers dance in a variety of alignment in due course.</p>

<h3>Parichakali dance</h3>
<p>The Parichakali dance is also a popular dance form in the islands of Lakshadweep. Parichakali literally translates as Shield dance, as Paricha refers to a shield and as the dance performed with sword and shields, it is called Parichakali. This dance form can be somewhat called a martial art form. The dance resembles fighting and therefore shields and sword are used as props. These are, however, made of very soft wood so that it does not wound anybody while enacting. Brave wars and warriors and freedom struggle are common themes. The dance usually involves dual combats and the bravery is honored in this Lakshadweep dance form. The performance is accompanied by songs.

<h2>Languages spoken in Lakshadweep</h2>
</center>
<p>The principal languages of Lakshadweep are Malayalam and Dhivehi. The people of all the northern islands speak Jeseri, a dialect of Malayalam with the influence of Arabic similar to Arabi Malayalam. The people of Minicoy, the southernmost atoll, speak Mahl, a variant of Divehi language spoken in the Maldives. Jeseri (also known as Jesri or Dweep Bhasha) is a dialect of Malayalam, spoken in Lakshadweep. It is spoken on the islands of Chetlat, Bitra, Kiltan, Kadmat, Amini, Kavaratti, Androth, Agatti, and Kalpeni, in the archipelago of Lakshadweep. Each of these islands has its own dialect. Malayalam written in the Malayalam script was introduced as the primary language of Lakshadweep during the British Raj, while previously a type of Arabic script, which is also known as Ponnani script or Arabi Malayalam script, was used for writing the language. This policy was continued by the Indian government. Malayalam serves as a link language on the islands including on the Mahl dominated Minicoy Island.</p>

<h2>Economy of Lakshadweep</h2>
<p>The Economy of Lakshadweep is mainly dependent on agriculture, fishery and the other flourishing industries here.

Thus the Lakshadweep economy is still an open one.</p>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
agriculture earns the livelihood for more than ninety percent of the population of this union territory. Coconut cultivation is a major economic activity of the people here. Very recently in some of the interior parts of the islands water logging was done to facilitate cultivation of rice and other food crops.Jowar, ragi, sweet potatoes, sorgum and banana are the other products of cultivation in Lakshadweep islands. Most of these crops are grown here after the rains. Otherwise coconut cultivation is the main occupation of the people of the Lakshadweep islands. It is known that millets were once cultivated here but the growing commercial demand for coconut have drawn the people of the islands to concentrate more on it.</p>
<h3>Fisheries</h3>
<p>Fisheries in Lakshadweep is also a very important economic activity. The department of fisheries was established here in the year 1959. They are looking after the production of fishes and the wellbeing of the fishermen here. With the growth of fishery boat building has also risen as an important occupation of some of the people here. Marketing and canning of the fishes involves a large number of people of the islands. Organized development of Lakshadweep fisheries started with the establishment of the official fisheries department here.The department of fisheries in Lakshadweep was developed in the year 1959 with the aim of increasing the fish production here. Socio- economic development of this region by creating wider scopes for self employment is the main aim of this department.Since the islands of Lakshadweep are surrounded by water on all sides so fishery is being considered as an important economic activity here. The department of fisheries has worked for the infrastructural development of conditions for fishery in Lakshadweep islands. The department introduced mechanized boats for fishing Tuna. Tuna is the only variety of fish that is abundantly available in the water surrounding the Lakshadweep group of islands. Marine workshops have been established in all the islands for the maintaining and repairing these fishing boats. Fisherman training centers are also established here by this department.Factory for canning Tuna fish has also been established in the islands of Lakshadweep. Thus fisheries in Lakshadweep have become the economic activity of many people here. To facilitate the functioning of the fisheries industry in Lakshadweep a development corporation for providing financial assistance has also been established here. Even fisherman cooperative societies are functioning here for the welfare of the people involved in the fishing trade.</p>
